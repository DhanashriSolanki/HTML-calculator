1.DISPLAY SCREEN
3 string are used with unique ids and the ids are used in js portion
first string takes the input
second string displays expression
third string display output
input tag is used and id is saved expression so that we can append more values

2.BUTTONS
5x4 buttons are used.
data-event_key for respective buttons is mentioned=> customed data attribute
all stylings are done using internal css

3.JQUERY FOR HANDLING KEY EVENTS
a> keypress=> 
whenever the key is pressed the data-event_key is activated and whatever is pressed is appended as long as it lies in given range
range(48,57) and (96,105) all inclusive are for numbers
if the entered button is an operator then it generates expression

b> keyup=>
used to deactivate the button otherwise it will be continuously pressed

c> click=>
the first two functions r used for keyboard button and this one is used for clicking the buttons we created
event_key means that it is a key and it is assigned to a user defined variable
if key is a number then it is appended
if it is an operator then it generates expression
if it is equal to then it evaluates
if it is delete then it clears the SCREEN

4.JAVASCRIPT functions
a> appendNumber(number)
$("#number_div").html(); this will assign the html content of the element to variable
currentString is watever we pass to the function
output is empty
if number exists then it checks whether its 0 or some other number and appends it
else it will append current to output

b> generateExpression(operator)
existing number is the input
expression is initialised as empty
.val() gets the value of input
if the saved expression is defined then it will convert the number to integer becoz we initially take input in string format and then the operator is appended

c> evaluateExpression()
no parameters in this function
we retrieve the saved expression, existing number
if expresseion is defined then we convert existing number to integer and append it to expression and store it in expression
eval() is built in function used to evaluate arithmetic expression

d> clearCalci()
all the fields of screen are made empty
